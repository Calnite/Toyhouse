Toyhouse CSS and HTML by Calnite

Don't copy, claim or retribute my code
    - You can share my Toyhouse code page, but never give anyone my raw code!

Don't remove my credit
    - Bro that would be really shitty of you.<br>
    - Even if you edit the code, you have to credit me.

Make sure to leave a comment on my forum if you use my code
    - I'm always curious to see what you did with it, nothing personal  :^)

You can always as me questions about the code
    - But don't ask me to make an entire new code for you

Disable WYSIWYG or the code will break
